Title: Seating plan and phone book intranet application

----

Text: 

## Find out where your colleagues sit or how to contact them.

Netpioneer’s “who’s sitting where” tool brought to a new level: Suitable for all locations, not just Karlsruhe, with an editor to adjust the tables and integration with tel.ad.diva-e.com and my.diva-e. Project is almost functional complete but look and feel could be improved.

https://tel.ad.diva-e.com/ already exists but could use some minor improvements.

**Skills needed: React and/or Java (for tel), Angular 6 and/or Kotlin (seat plan), Design and/or UX (both)**
