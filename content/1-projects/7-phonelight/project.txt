Title: PhoneLight

----

Text: 

The diva-e office in Munich (Tassiloplatz) uses PhillipsHue lamps for requesting silence if someone is in a call. Currently everyone can turn on the lights using a super simple Electron-App. The lamps of the room (where the person sits in) then turns red and everybody else knows that there is a call ongoing. But there are no more features.

I would like to extend and implement much more features into this small Application.

Some ideas are:

* Info about the person who turned on the light.
* Reminder after period of time if the light should stay on.
* Better response time of the lamps â€“ sometimes ist delayed
* Better room organization

**And of course all ideas you have!**
