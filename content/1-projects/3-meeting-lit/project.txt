Title: Meeting Lite

----

Text: 

## When is my next meeting? Reminder not set? Missed a meeting? Happens like all the time, right?
The idea of this hack is to visualize upcomming meetings using a kind of traffic light for meetings. We would like to use multiple RGB-LED’s as a timeline and based on the color it represents if and when a meeting is in your calendar.

The idea is not definded in detail – I’m open for discussion and inspiration.
