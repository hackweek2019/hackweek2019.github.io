Title: Hackphones

----

Text: 

## This hack is about bringing your old lame wired headphone to the next level!
We will be going to build our own bluetooth audio adapter to replace the wire in our headphones. From printing our custom PCB to soldering the components and battery.

This project does not have a maximum team size, although I think at least 3 people would be more fun.

Bring your own headphone. More infos coming soon.
