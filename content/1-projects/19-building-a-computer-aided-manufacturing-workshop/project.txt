Title: Building a computer aided manufacturing workshop

----

Text: 

## The purpose of our undertaking is the erection of a maker’s workshop for manufacturing of tools and parts with the aid of open source software.

This includes a 3D printer and a CNC mill for the production of parts as well as some classical tools and materials that are needed to produce parts.

Thus we will be able to provide assistance for other hacks of the hackweek and future projects by constructing and manufacturing parts for them!

What we will build and provide for other projects:
– Shapeoko MAX mill 120×80 cm (powered by arduino, grbl)
– 3D printer (BQ Hephestos 2 or Prusa i3 MK3 or Kossel)
– Stock of aluminiun, acryl and plywood for milling
– abs/pla & pet filament for 3D printing of parts
– tools, screws, bolts, …

Who is the perfect co-worker in this hack? Everybody! Come as you are! No knowledge needed, just feeling like doing something with your hands and some enthusiasm for CAD/CAM and Open Source Software.
